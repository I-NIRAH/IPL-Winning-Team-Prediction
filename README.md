# IPL Winning Team Prediction using Machine Learning (Google Colab)

This project predicts the winning team in an IPL (Indian Premier League) match based on match conditions, team statistics, and historical data using machine learning models. It provides insights into what factors influence match outcomes in T20 cricket.

## Project Description

This project:
- Uses past IPL match data (e.g., team, venue, toss winner, toss decision, etc.).
- Preprocesses data (e.g., encoding teams, handling missing values).
- Trains machine learning models to predict the match winner.
- Visualizes key features and model performance.
- Runs entirely on **Google Colab** â€” no local installation required.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook**  
    [Click here to open the Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kLax9EZ7gLnRBBuVAtOCmgWQifBXPLJy?usp=sharing)  
   

2. **Upload the Dataset**  
   Use datasets like `IPL_Matches_2008_2022.csv` from [Kaggle IPL Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
   Upload the CSV file to Colab when prompted.

3. **Run All Cells**  
   The notebook will:
   - Load and preprocess IPL match data
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Predict the winning team and evaluate accuracy

## Sample Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost (optional)
- 
## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Feature Importance Visualization

## Features Considered

- Team1 and Team2
- Toss Winner & Toss Decision
- Venue
- City
- Season
- Match Winner
